# YoutubeAPI_EDA
## Using YouTubeAPI for generating dataset and Performing EDA

This project involves analyzing data from a YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API v3. The main objectives are to fetch channel statistics, get details of videos uploaded to the channel, preprocess the data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.

## Objectives:
1) Initialize the YouTube Client: Set up the YouTube Data API client to interact with YouTube data.
2) Fetch Channel Statistics: Retrieve general statistics about the YouTube channel, such as the number of subscribers, total views, and total videos.
3) Get Video Details: Extract detailed information about each video in the channel's upload playlist, including video statistics and metadata.
4) Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes converting data types, handling missing values, and creating new features.
5) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the data to discover patterns and insights about the channel's performance and audience engagement.

## Tools and Libraries
1) Python: Main programming language.
2) Google API Client: To interact with YouTube Data API.
3) Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
4) Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
5) WordCloud: To create word cloud visualizations.
6) NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like removing stop words.
## Data Preprocessing
1) Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric, datetime).
2) Handle missing or inconsistent data.
3) Create new features, such as the day of the week a video was published and the duration of videos in seconds.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1) Best and Worst Performing Videos: Identify the videos with the highest and lowest view counts.
2) View Distribution: Visualize the distribution of views across different videos.
3) Engagement Metrics: Analyze the relationship between views, likes, and comments.
4) Word Cloud: Generate a word cloud to visualize the most common words in video titles.
5) Upload Day Analysis: Determine the distribution of video uploads by day of the week.
